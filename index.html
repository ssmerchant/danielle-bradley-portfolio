								<h1>Danielle Bradley</h1>
								<p>I am a creative. Though that is a broad term, allow me to elaborate. Growing up, my morning
									routine was having music for breakfast and then I’d go workout by writing about everything. I’d
									then head to school where we all studied the standards; history, math, science, English, etc.
									And in each class I’d learn by creating scenes in my head. The freshman boy never simply
									passed by his junior crush, no! I saw the freshman glance at the junior and every light went off,
									and they suddenly lit up in green and pink, and the only sound heard was the freshman’s
									heartbeat. It knew it was doomed to never get a glance back. Then all the lights came on, and I
									was standing at my locker staring at a wall. Not only have I gained life,
									creative, academic, and social experience in receiving my degree, but my purpose was
									confirmed even more so than I thought I could be. I traveled down many different academic
									paths throughout college, but I found myself by having music for breakfast, and exercising my
									ready-to-write fingers everyday, and by picturing life not as it is, but as it should be by creating
									scenes for every mundane thing possible. I say all this to say I may not have much paid
									professional work, but I have something more than that. Experience, passion, and the desire to
									learn more, to be more. To write and to sing, to produce and direct, to continue building
									experience. I say all this to say I am a creative.</p>

The ones who grieve every conversation they’ve never had, the people they can’t talk to anymore. The parts of themselves they stay awake to remember. This is for the blue souls who mourn each tear they’ve shed for undeserving people. This is for all the attacked, betrayed, invisible, hated, and misunderstood.</p>

								<h3>If She's Dead, I Might Be Too</h3>
								<p>I think she robbed me.
									She robbed me blind like the shadow robs the scientist of his stars.
									I think she died. I saw her breathless face lying in a casket.
									A chrysanthemum garden with forget-me-not sprinklings,
									brown wooden hair.
									Or maybe the casket was wood.
									Wooden like the cherry oor her noose last saw,
									or maybe it was metal,
									almost like the kind of music she listened to.
									Someone said she was buried after- 10 feet underground,
									a foot of just leave, two feet of can’t talk right now,
									three feet of I’m ﬁne,
									she told me she saved the last four for me.
									She knew I’d need a spot next to her in the warm, furry dirt
									and when she died she took with her two lives,
									one friend,
									one murderer.
									But I can never remember correctly my memory was shot,
									I think it was shot somewhere between 7:30 pm,
									two eyes,
									and an “i love u no matter what.”
									See, I can’t tell if she died because I remember what she said-
									she came to visit after the funeral after I drank two bottles of red.
									I said I’d nish the third if she would help me nish the rest
									she committed to her task, started the fourth,
									and whatever was left ended up on her wrists.
									- If she’s dead, I might be too</p>
									<br>
								<h3>I Used To Tall To Walls</h3>
								<p>I used to talk to walls.
									I’d sit in the corner of my old rotted house and I’d whisper secrets to the walls.
									I’d tell them about my day. I’d tell them about my likes, my dislikes, I’d tell them who I was.
									But they’d never tell me who they were.
									I’d sit in the corner and try to have a conversation with the chipped yellow paint.
									All they ever gave me back in response,
									Was the sound of my own voice.
									Echoing through spider nests, through roof shingles,
									“How are you?”
									“You know the answer.”
									Each question I asked, the wall would repeat.
									I thought the repetition of each meaningless and void question was good.
									I thought it was inclusive.
									But there was no substance.
									For my voice soon became the only thing I heard, and the only thing they talked about.
									All of a sudden, the walls never stopped listening,
									They never stopped repeating.
									“Hello” turned into
									“Please leave me alone”
									And that’s what broke me.
									The walls were the ones that harassed me.
									They played the mockingbird game
									They sung all the unoriginal tunes
									They never left my head, and yet
									Here they were.
									Asking me to please leave them alone.
									As if I hadn't begged year after year for some peace.
									So I did.
									I let them be, and I let them see how alone they would stay.
									I tied a rope from the fan that hung near the chipped yellow paint.
									I said goodbye and heard it back.
									I became a fleshly, unanimated pile of unheard words.
									I peeled from the ceiling just as the yellow paint had done for years.
									I’ve moved on from the walls.
									Now I talk to a little girl who sits in a yellow corner,
									Surrounded by peeling chemicals, talking to walls.
									She’ll never hear the invisible tears I cry.
									For walls repeat, but when ghosts linger,
									There is no voice to follow.
									Only the footsteps that led to that rotted corner,
									That walked my body to the wooden fan,
									And the sound of silence that asked “please leave me alone.”
									I used to talk to walls.
									Until my memory became a part of them.
									- i used to talk to walls</p>
									<br>
								<h3>The Dead Must Be Alive</h3>
								<p>I live because of the living. But I live for the dead. I have lived two lives in 22 years and
									restarted each three times. I have been the honoree at the funeral, the one they all pray and send
									chrysanthemums over, only no one attended mine because it was not me that was shot. My
									second death I was visited in the hospital after being taken off life support, only the cards were
									not addressed to me, because the brown-haired, short, lanky body that lay in the hospital bed was
									not mine. And the third life I started began with a stubby oak tree. A yellow journal. And fifth
									grade. Maybe this time I did not simply die. Maybe I was murdered. Two feet led me up a tree
									and out to the edge of its branches and slung me down. I waited for people to greet me at my
									grave, the walking corpse collecting memories and whispers, but no one ever said hello. My
									name was not the one on the tombstone. I’ve felt life the strongest months after each death. I
									could swear the first time I was buried, I felt the warmth of flesh appear three months later. Flesh
									in the shape of sun-spotted fingers displaying a wedding ring. I clung to this warmth until I saw
									strands of sun on a woman with forehead crinkles and expressively sad eyebrows. I remember
									calling her “mom” but it took me a while to recognize her. My second resurrection was brought
									about by a little girl that turned into a sister who kept screaming a sound that turned into a name.
									“Your name!” she said. My name. I could not hear it correctly for many years, but I’ve learned to
									pronounce it clearly and audibly. The third start of life took no flesh. No screaming, no rings, no
									little girl. It took nothing. It was given to me. My breathing skeleton began to throw out words to
									the heavens knowing it would be better for all the prayers to sink than to not say any at all. Some
									pieces, whether caught in space or heard somewhere beyond, returned. I got fragments of life
									with memories to sustain. I breathe out life, I breathe out death in and out and in and out again. I
									live because of the living. But parts of me are dead somewhere with them.
									- the dead must be alive</p>
									<br>
								<h3>A Cold Kind of Sun</h3>
								<p>It was a cold day. A sunny day down by the river. It was a silent day. Silent, unlike the past four
									years. Sunny, unlike the past decade. The cold was familiar. Not the ice on the grass, wind in the
									trees kind of cold. It was a cold like the shoulder my sister offers. Cold like the cough drops my
									mother would feed me. The silence was new. Silent, unlike the murmurs of my mind. Silent,
									unlike the rhymes mother would sing to me before bed. Silent, like my cries for help. Silent, like
									my dad remains each and every year. I looked around, only to see that I was alone. Alone with
									trees dancing over my head as if to cheer me up. Alone on a wooden bridge that guided me
									towards the smell of water. Green and brown were the branches that reached out to touch my
									hair. Cold was the water that hugged my ankles, and comforting was the pink of the flowers that
									blossomed in the dead bushes below. The whispers of the wind grew warm with sunlight. The
									sunlight smelled like honey yet mocked me with how long it would stay. Playing hide and seek
									in the sky, the clouds would wave goodbye to the sun, and hello to the cold. And the cold would
									mumble “hello” on the back of my neck, and within the creases of my spine. Yet, every few
									minutes the sun would demand to shine. And when it would pronounce hello, syrup would run
									down my throat, and encase my chest in a liquid warmth. When it left to say hello to the moon,
									the cold took over. The clouds and the cold felt bitter before when it stole the sun's glow of day.
									But now, the cold had waited for its turn to blow. With notes of ice and shutters of chill, it
									became soothing. For it cooled down my heated heart, and numbed my hands from the picking of
									my nails. It took away the pain of the day, and everything highlighted by the sun. Sure, I was
									numb. But finally, it was silent. Only the sound of creaks from steps on the wooden bridge, and
									leaves pushing into each other remained. I was numb, but not alone. It was the cold, the water,
									the trees, the bushes, and the sun that warmed me up and dried me out. All on that cold, silent,
									sunny day.</p>
									<br>
								<h3>Musical Chairs of the Mind</h3>
								<p>When I was a child, the playground never enticed me. I did not know how to play with
									other people invading my space. If I was to play, I would need enough room to imagine. It’s hard
									to imagine a pirate ship at sea when a first grader is standing on land at the bottom of it. I would
									need my space. Instead of playing tag, hide and seek, or capture the flag, I would play inside of
									myself. I built a playground in my mind. I stuffed it full with all the things I wanted to learn and all
									the ways I wanted to play. My mind soon developed a melody that I would hear everyday
									coming from down the hallway outside the little classroom where my imagination became
									concentrated on curiosity and the need to satisfy it. The melody took on the form of a hum. Ms.
									Neely, our school music teacher, would walk down the hallway each day humming the same
									four notes. Sometimes she’d whistle them. When I would go home, my mother would tuck me
									into bed and sing me a song. I started to sing along with her. I never had to think about where
									my voice was going. In school, a math problem would be displayed on the board and I would
									have to think long and hard about the answers to the problem, and they still would never come. I
									didn’t know if I was too dumb to understand math, or if I was too complacent about two plus four
									because I really did not care about solving the problem. Whenever science was being taught, I’d
									open my textbook and I’d look at the pictures of rocks, animals, and plants but that was as far
									as my attention would stretch. Today, I could tell you that there are things called cells and that is
									what everything is made up of. But if you’d like me to tell you how many bones are in the body,
									and what their names are, I’d say six and Thursday. But then, there was music. See, I didn’t
									understand music, it understood me. I viewed music as gravity. It was like a magnet. I never
									understood how my mother was able to change from note to note so quickly whenever she sang
									me to bed, I just knew that I could do it. I didn’t want to understand why, I would just do it. All I
									could ever hear floating around my skull were melodies my mother sang, and harmonies I could
									hear within each word. I always felt helpless in school and during recess. But then I crafted this
									music room in my mind, and that is where I played, lived, and endured. It was filled with many
									different sounds, and as I learned what instruments existed, and which ones I liked the sound of,
									they all lined the walls of my imaginary, yet very real music room. I wanted to be music. I wanted
									to be fascinating, I wanted to be fluid, I wanted to be colorful. But I am not music. I am a child.
									And I have a playground. And it understands.
									- Musical chairs of the mind</p>
									<br>
								<h3>Reflection</h3>
								<p>I looked up and saw this thing staring back at me.
									Before I bit into my bread, before I tasted the soup sitting in front of me,
									I glanced forward
									To a stranger wearing dark clothes stylized with profanities written in red up and down the sleeves.
									A terrifying creature slouched back into the cafe chair with head hanging low and shoulders hunched
									over.
									A beast covered in water that it spent its life crying.
									I glanced down
									To see ropes bonding the legs of the misshapen form to bricks labeled
									INSECURITY
									UNRELIABILITY
									DISHONESTY
									This beast mimicked me, my every movement.
									This terrifying creature stared into the depths of my calloused soul.
									This stranger started to add more water to the unending ocean that cascaded down her cheeks.
									And if I focused hard enough, the brick labels all shift
									From insecurity, unreliability, dishonesty
									To display a broken human
									With a label written on her forehead that read
									misunderstood.
									- reflection</p>
									<br>
								<h3>I Still See You on my Left Shoulder</h3>
								<p>I saw you sitting by yourself.
									While all the other kids played football on concrete
									And aspiring Kobe Bryant’s shot the basketball through the leaning tree branches
									And tiny artists drew hopscotch on the sidewalk filled with potholes,
									You sat by yourself.
									I saw you clean off your glasses, they were fogged. Frankly, I only noticed you because you
									weren’t drawn to the crowds of bubbles in the sky, you weren’t drawn towards the laughter
									roaring from the other kids’ bellies. I didn’t understand why. I was much like you. Barely enticed,
									never entertained enough.
									I approached you to talk about nothing important but to understand why you sat by yourself. I
									asked, “how are you?” Nine letters. Three words. I expected a four letter response. “Good.” Just
									as every person is trained to say “I’m fine.” No fifth grader would say anything else. You said
									nothing.
									Your inquisitive look dropped. Your demeanor shifted. You went from “onlooker” to “lost soul” in
									five seconds. You looked at me through foggy glasses and asked “why can’t I be happy”. I
									thought the bubbles blown weren’t enough to hold your attention even though they certainly
									captivated you five minutes ago.
									Five minutes before I asked my question. I expected a simple answer because I took you as a
									simple minded little girl who wanted to play with her friends. I did not respond. I let you cry into
									my shoulder, my left shoulder. Which is still stained with you.
									I’m glad I saw you sitting by yourself.
									Because the next time I saw you, you hung by yourself from a big oak tree. This is no happy
									story. Just know I saw you sitting by yourself, I saw the foggy glasses, I saw the little girl trapped
									inside, I saw it all.
									I saw you.
									Living by yourself,
									Dying alone.
									On that big oak tree.
									- I still see you on my left shoulder</p>
									<br>
								<h3>Lifelong Hangover</h3>
								<p>I saw them give you flowers.
									In celebration of a life fully lived.
									I heard the words said.
									By groups full of people that knew you by the mask you paraded around in
									As if it was your best invention.
									A sea of chrysanthemum and letters displaying the words
									“We miss you”
									“Wish you were here”
									“We love you”
									Remembrance was everywhere.
									While everyone was holding your memory close in their hearts,
									I was trying to forget.
									I tried drowning your memory at the bottom of liquor bottles,
									Only for you to come back up and hangover my head for a week.
									I tried only recognizing your scent through the charade you carried around
									Of confidence and certainty.
									Little did they know confidence was a foreign thing,
									And death was the only thing you were certain about.
									Tonight, I buried you in a bottle of red wine,
									And tomorrow I’ll find you again at the bottom of my whiskey.
									People would never say the words “we miss you”
									If they fully grasped the weight of what they were missing.
									How awful it is to miss someone
									Who is too important to miss.
									So I must always try to forget.
									Because I lived my life trying to extend yours.
									At least this way,
									Part of my life, some iota of it,
									is still dedicated to you.
									I'd rather not miss you,
									I'd rather not remember.
									Having you here is the only alternative.
									So I refuse to miss you.
									If I do,
									It means you are gone as if you were never here.
									That is impossible to me,
									So for now,
									Thanks for sharing the bottle of wine with me,
									I’ll talk to you when the whiskey is gone.
									- lifelong hangover</p>
									<br>
								
								<h3>The Mind Remembers</h3>
								<p>I have slept in many places.
									Places stained with red.
									Not the red that seeps from my veins,
									But from evil thoughts that existed inside old lovers' heads.
									I could not fashion a room,
									For it was never mine to change.
									So a room was laid out for me,
									Filled with violence, lies, and rage.
									The floors were painted in the shade Manipulator
									A bright extravagant scarlett.
									It was so bright I barely looked at it,
									So bright I only ignored it.
									I then would focus on the walls,
									A soft dark red named Narcissist.
									It was captivating for a while,
									Until I learned that with it, I could not exist.
									So I’d make my leave to the bedroom, but its access is limited.
									To go in, you must have a badge.
									A badge named Innocent.
									I lost that badge under a dresser named Take.
									The darkest red of all.
									One day Take took too much, and is now doomed to crawl
									As a carpet in a room locked in with no friends,
									In a room with only metal and straw,
									A jail named Revenge.
									- the mind remembers</p>
									<br>
								<h3>I Am The Product of Destruction</h3>
								<p>I am the product.
									Formed in the belly of a broken home whose foundation was built on being right instead of doing
									right.
									Shipped away to school to learn science, math, and how words beat as much as hands do
									And how instructors never see what they witness.
									Sent off to fall in love with someone who did not care about being right, only doing right.
									How tragic.
									I was prepared to destroy every counter-argument offered,
									And to obliterate any hope that remained.
									I could deceive and do it well.
									I could argue with my eyes and beat with my words
									I could be prepared for any destruction.
									Oblivious to the path of wildfire that I have laid out behind my feet since I walked out of the
									unlaid foundation that I was built upon.
									I was sent off to fall in love, when every piece of love I had won,
									Was formed,
									Shipped away,
									And sent off.
									- I am the product of destruction.</p>
